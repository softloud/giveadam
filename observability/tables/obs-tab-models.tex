\hspace{1em}\cellcolor{gray!10}{sem\_top3} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Each row a ranking of top 3 SDG priorities, by one respondent from either the Tehri or Arunachal survey. In particular this step ensures that the SDG labels are harmonised across the two surveys.}\\

\hspace{1em}se\_top3\_arunachal & Each row represents a respondent's ranking top 3 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Arunachal Pradesh, India. These data are extracted in wide format from the original survey data preserving labelling for data validation.\\

\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Base Models}}\\
\hspace{1em}base\_arunachal & Raw data from survey in Arunachal Pradesh, collected by Dr Garima Gupta. Each row represents the survey responses of a single respondent. This step loads the data into the pipeline and establishes an identifier for each respondent. Only top 5 ranking and age and gender in these data, an extraction from the full arunachal dataset which is not available due to institutional restrictions. For this pipeline the top 3 rankings are extracted for analysis.\\
\hspace{1em}\cellcolor{gray!10}{base\_tehri} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Raw data from survey in Tehri, collected by Dr Garima Gupta. Each row represents the survey responses of a single respondent. This step loads the data into the pipeline and establishes an identifier for each respondent. See `raw\_data/tehri\_cols.md` for details on all questions included in this dataset.}\\
